I hold a master's degree in Computational Natural Sciences, and a couple of other degrees, but for the purposes of this blog they are irrelevant. So, what's this blog about? </p> <p>During my time doing research in undergrad, I realized there are very few resources that talk about Molecular Dynamics theory. After painfully reading tons of research papers and books for simple foundational knowledge, I finally published a research paper. After tons of contemplating, I decided I want to teach folks about foundational MD theory that's simple to understand.

Prior to simulations, the only other method to do this was to make use of a theory that provided an approximate description of the material.</p> </li> <li> <p>Many experimentalists use MD simulations as a tool to analyze or interpret their measurements whenever the system becomes significantly complex.

They each exert a force on each other. As a result, every atom experiences a resultant force, which causes it to move in a certain direction:</p> <p>For the purposes of representation, all attractive forces have been portrayed in the figure on the left, but there could be repulsive forces between the two atoms. The resultant force exerted on atom 1 is shown in the figure on the right, which will determine the direction of movement of the atom.</p> <p>If we know the force and the mass of the atom, we can calculate the acceleration of the atom. Why can't we use Newton's second equation of motion to determine where the particle would be positioned at a certain time in the future?</p> <p>Well, lets take a look at how we CAN solve a physics problem using Newton's second equation of motion:</p> <p>Consider a ball falling from a large height. At time t = 0, it is at a height of 1000m, and it has no speed at the given time. What is the height of the ball at t = 10s?</p> <p>We know that the particle falls at a constant acceleration of \\(g = 9.8 \\frac{m}{s^2}\\) in the downward direction. By Newton's second equation of motion, after time \\(t\\):</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} s &amp;= ut + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 \\end{align*} \\] <p>Where \\(s\\) = displacement, \\(u\\) is the initial velocity \\((= 0)\\), and \\(a\\) is the acceleration of the ball. In the equation, we write \\(a = -g\\) to denote that the acceleration is in the downward direction.</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} s &amp;= \\frac{1}{2} (-9) (10)^2 \\\\ &amp;= -450 \\\\ x_t - x_0 &amp;= -450 \\\\ x_t - 1000 &amp;= -450 \\\\ x_t &amp;= 550m \\end{align*} \\] <p>Simple enough, right? We were able to find out the particle of the ball after 5 seconds. Using the above equation, we can find out the position of the particle at any time before it hits the ground by basic substitution.</p> <p>In order to find out why this can't directly be applied to our molecular system, we have to trace the roots of Newton's second equation of motion. Where does it come from?</p> <p>Let's take a closer look at Newton's second equation of motion. We know that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Starting from there:</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} \\frac{dv}{dt} &amp;= a  \\end{align*} \\] <p>Multiplying both sides by \\(dt\\) and integrating both sides from \\(0\\) to \\(t\\),</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} \\int_{u}^vdv &amp;= \\int_{0}^t a dt  \\end{align*} \\] <p>Where \\(u\\) denotes initial velocity of the particle and \\(v\\) denotes the velocity of the particle at time \\(t\\).</p> <p>Derivation of Newton's second equation of motion assumes that the acceleration of the particle is constant. In the case of the ball, acceleration of the ball is constant with time - equal to \\(g\\) in the downward direction.</p> <p>But in the case of atomistic interactions, that's not quite true. One of the forces that acts between two atoms is a bonded force that depends on the distance between the two atoms. Consider atom 1 in figure 1, and the interaction between atom 1 and 2. The force on atom 1 due to the interaction can be written as follows:</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} \\textbf{F}_{b1} &amp;= \\frac{1}{2} k_{12} (\\textbf{q}_2 - \\textbf{q}_1) \\end{align*} \\] <p>Where \\(\\textbf{F}_{b1}\\) is the force on atom 1 solely due to this bonded interaction between atom 1 and 2, \\(\\textbf{q}_1\\) is the position vector of atom 1, and \\(\\textbf{q}_2\\) is the position vector of atom 2. In 3 dimensions, </p> <ul> <li>\\(\\textbf{q}_1 = [q_{1x}, q_{1y}, q_{1z}]\\)</li> <li>\\(\\textbf{q}_2 = [q_{2x}, q_{2y}, q_{2z}]\\)</li> <li>\\(q_{1x}, q_{1y}, q_{1z}, q_{2x}, q_{2y}, q_{2z}\\) are all scalar quantities.</li> </ul> <p>In effect, the Force is a function of the position of the position, which changes with time:</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} \\textbf{F}_{b1} &amp;= f(\\textbf{q}_1(t)) \\\\ &amp;= g(t) \\end{align*} \\] <p>By Newton's second law, the acceleration is also a function of time:</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} \\textbf{a}(t) &amp;= \\frac{\\textbf{F}(t)}{m_1} \\end{align*} \\] <p>Note that the above force calculated is just a result of the bonded force between atom 1 and atom 2, to get the point across. We have many more forces acting on atom 1, but those will be explored later.</p> <p>Furthermore, the acceleration is not a simple function of time, like \\(a = c t^2\\) that can be easily integrated. The acceleration is a function of the position itself, which is a major issue. </p> <ul> <li>The position is dependent on the net acceleration of the atom.</li> <li>The acceleration of the atom is dependent on the position of the atom.</li> </ul> <p>So how do we integrate this equation? Let's take a look at that in the next chapter.</p>"}]}
