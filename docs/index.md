# Introduction

Hi! I'm [Shaunak Badani](https://shaunak-badani.github.io/), the author of this blog. I hold a master's degree in Computational Natural Sciences, and a couple of other degrees, but for the purposes of this blog they are irrelevant. So, what's this blog about? 

During my time doing research in undergrad, I realized there are very few resources that talk about Molecular Dynamics theory. After painfully reading tons of research papers and books for simple foundational knowledge, I finally published a [research paper](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-abstract/157/18/184102/2841995/Enhanced-sampling-using-replica-exchange-with?redirectedFrom=fulltext). After tons of contemplating, I decided I want to teach folks about foundational MD theory that's simple to understand. And this is the result!
