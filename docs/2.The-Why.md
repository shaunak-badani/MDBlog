# Why do we perform MD simulations?

- In order to predict the properties of a molecular substance (from [Frenkel and Smit., chapter 1](https://datagrid.hu/boda/Boda-sajat/Rush/Books/Frenkel.pdf)).


    Molecular simulations done using a computer help predict molecular properties of a substance. Prior to simulations, the only other method to do this was to make use of a theory that provided an approximate description of the material.

- Many experimentalists use MD simulations as a tool to analyze or interpret their measurements whenever the system becomes significantly complex. ([M.A.Gonzalez](https://www.neutron-sciences.org/articles/sfn/pdf/2011/01/sfn201112009.pdf))

    This was observed in the case of neutron scattering, when experimental observables correlate directly with properties deduced from MD simulations.

- MD simulations can be used to study protein dynamics and function and understand how they bind with small molecules or other proteins. ([Outi M. H. Salo-Ahen](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/9/1/71))

    Drug discovery processes often start with identifying and validating a biologically relevant target (often different kinds of proteins) that can be modulated with drug molecules to prevent or cure a disease or alleviate symptoms of sickness. MD simulations can provide important information on the dynamic character of the target with regard to drug design.
