# Dumbing down the complex molecular system

At the end of the day, protein molecules and other different types of molecules are just a set of atoms bunched together. They each exert a force on each other. As a result, every atom experiences a resultant force, which causes it to move in a certain direction:

<!-- Insert figures 1 and 2 here -->

For the purposes of representation, all attractive forces have been portrayed in Figure 1, but there could be repulsive forces between the two atoms. The resultant force exerted on atom 1 is shown in Figure 2, which will determine the direction of movement of the atom.

> If we know the force and the mass of the atom, we can calculate the acceleration of the atom. Why can't we use Newton's second equation of motion to determine where the particle would be positioned at a certain time in the future?

Well, lets take a look at how we CAN solve a physics problem using Newton's second equation of motion:

> Consider a ball falling from a large height. At time t = 0, it is at a height of 1000m, and it has no speed at the given time. What is the height of the ball at t = 10s?

We know that the particle falls at a constant acceleration of $g = 9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ in the downward direction. By Newton's second equation of motion, after time $t$:

$$
\begin{align*}
s &= ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
\end{align*}
$$

Where $s$ = displacement, $u$ is the initial velocity $(= 0)$, and $a$ is the acceleration of the ball. In the equation, we write $a = -g$ to denote that the acceleration is in the downward direction.

$$
\begin{align*}
s &= \frac{1}{2} (-9) (10)^2 \\
&= -450 \\
x_t - x_0 &= -450 \\
x_t - 1000 &= -450 \\
x_t &= 550m
\end{align*}
$$

Simple enough, right? We were able to find out the particle of the ball after 5 seconds. Using the above equation, we can find out the position of the particle *at any time before it hits the ground* by basic substitution.

In order to find out why this can't directly be applied to our molecular system, we have to trace the roots of Newton's second equation of motion. Where does it come from?

Let's take a closer look at Newton's second equation of motion. We know that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Starting from there:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dv}{dt} &= a 
\end{align*}
$$

Multiplying both sides by $dt$ and integrating both sides from $0$ to $t$,

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{u}^vdv &= \int_{0}^t a dt 
\end{align*}
$$

Where $u$ denotes initial velocity of the particle and $v$ denotes the velocity of the particle at time $t$.

Derivation of Newton's second equation of motion **assumes that the acceleration of the particle is constant**. In the case of the ball, acceleration of the ball is constant with time - equal to $g$ in the downward direction.

But in the case of atomistic interactions, that's not quite true. One of the forces that acts between two atoms is a bonded force that depends on the distance between the two atoms. Consider atom 1 in figure 1, and the interaction between atom 1 and 2. The force on atom 1 due to the interaction can be written as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{F}_{b1} &= \frac{1}{2} k_{12} (\textbf{q}_2 - \textbf{q}_1)
\end{align*}
$$

Where $\textbf{F}_{b1}$ is the force on atom 1 solely due to this bonded interaction between atom 1 and 2, $\textbf{q}_1$ is the position vector of atom 1, and $\textbf{q}_2$ is the position vector of atom 2. In 3 dimensions, 

- $\textbf{q}_1 = [q_{1x}, q_{1y}, q_{1z}]$
- $\textbf{q}_2 = [q_{2x}, q_{2y}, q_{2z}]$
- $q_{1x}, q_{1y}, q_{1z}, q_{2x}, q_{2y}, q_{2z}$ are all scalar quantities.

In effect, the Force is a function of the position of the position, which changes with time:

$$
\begin{align*}
\textbf{F}_{b1} &= f(\textbf{q}_1) \\
&= f(t)
\end{align*}
$$

By Newton's second law, the acceleration is also a function of time:

$$
\begin{align*}
\texbf{a}(t) &= \frac{\texbf{F}(t)}{m_1}
&&

So how do we integrate this equation now? Let's take a look at that in the next chapter.
